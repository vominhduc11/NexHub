# NexHub - Microservices E-Commerce Platform

## Executive Summary

**NexHub** is a production-ready e-commerce microservices platform built on Spring Boot 3.5.4, designed for scalable product management, warranty tracking, customer operations, and content management. The platform features distributed architecture with Redis caching, Kafka event streaming, WebSocket real-time communication, and comprehensive JWT security across 6 specialized PostgreSQL databases.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

|-----------|------|-------------|---------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | 5432 | Primary database | 6 separate databases with proper isolation |
| **Redis** | 6379 | Cache & session store | Password-protected, persistent storage |
| **Kafka Cluster** | 9092-9094 | Message streaming | 3-broker cluster with Zookeeper |
| **Zookeeper** | 2181-2183 | Kafka coordination | 3-node ensemble for HA |

## üîê Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: RSA-256 signatures with JWKS endpoint (`/auth/.well-known/jwks.json`)
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, Customer, Reseller with appropriate permissions
- **Gateway Security**: JWT forwarding filter with automatic claim extraction
- **Session Management**: Redis-based session storage
- **CORS Support**: Multi-origin support for frontend applications

### Security Flow
```
Client ‚Üí API Gateway (JWT Validation) ‚Üí Service (Role Authorization) ‚Üí Database
                ‚Üì
        Notification Service (Kafka) ‚Üí Email/WebSocket
```

## üìä Database Design

### Database-per-Service Pattern
The platform uses 6 dedicated PostgreSQL databases to ensure proper service isolation:

```
nexhub_auth         ‚Üí Authentication accounts, roles, permissions
nexhub_user         ‚Üí Customer and Reseller profiles
nexhub_product      ‚Üí Product catalog, media, categories, serials
nexhub_warranty     ‚Üí Warranty tracking and claims
nexhub_blog         ‚Üí Blog posts, categories, authors, comments
nexhub_notification ‚Üí Email and notification history
```

### Core Technologies
| Category | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Runtime** | Java | 17 | Application runtime |
| **Framework** | Spring Boot | 3.5.4 | Microservices framework |
| **Build Tool** | Maven | 3.6+ | Dependency management |

### Service Communication
- **Service Discovery**: Netflix Eureka for service registration
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway with JWT forwarding
- **Sync Communication**: OpenFeign with load balancing
- **Async Messaging**: Kafka with consumer groups and producers
- **Real-time**: WebSocket with STOMP protocol and SockJS fallback
- **Email Delivery**: Spring Mail with Gmail SMTP integration

## üê≥ Deployment Strategy

### Docker Architecture
The platform uses Docker Compose with service dependencies and health checks:

**Infrastructure Layer:**
- PostgreSQL (with init scripts for 6 databases)
- Redis (password-protected with persistent volumes)  
- Zookeeper Ensemble (3-node cluster, ports 2181-2183)
- Kafka Cluster (3 brokers, ports 9092-9094)

**Service Layer:**
- Config Server (8888) ‚Üí Discovery Service (8761) ‚Üí API Gateway (8080)
- Business Services with health checks and auto-restart policies

**Service Port Mappings:**
```
Host:Container Ports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Product Service: 8084:8080 (internal port 8080)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Blog Service: 8087:8080 (internal port 8080)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Other Services: Direct port mapping
```

### Resilience & Monitoring
- Health check endpoints (`/actuator/health`) on all services
- 30-second health check intervals with 3 retries
- Graceful startup dependencies with service health conditions
- Auto-restart policy: `unless-stopped`

## ‚ö° Real-time Communication & Performance

### WebSocket Features
**Real-time Messaging**: STOMP protocol with SockJS fallback at `/api/notification/ws/notifications`
**Security**: JWT-based authentication with role-based subscription authorization
**Channels**: Public broadcasts, role-specific channels, and private messaging
**Testing**: HTML WebSocket client included (`websocket-test.html`)

### Redis Caching Strategy
**Implementation**: Distributed caching across Product, User, and Warranty services
**Configuration**: Password-protected Redis with 10-minute TTL
**Cache Keys**: Composite keys for paginated results and search queries
**Performance**: Sub-millisecond cache retrieval vs database queries
